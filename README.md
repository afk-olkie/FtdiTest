# FtdiTest
This tiny program is intended to benchmark the read speed of an FTDI FT232H IC in async/sync 245 mode. Mainly for wanting to use the FT232H as a cheap Logic Analyzer.


See http://blog.olkie.com/2015/03/24/um232h-logic-analyzer/ for rationale behind this tiny program as well as some binary files.

See [FtdiTest.cpp](https://github.com/afk-olkie/FtdiTest/blob/master/FtdiTest.cpp)
 in this repo for more details.
